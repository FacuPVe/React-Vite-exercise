# React + Vite

This is an exercise with React working in Vite.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Terminal commands

Installing Vite for the first time (use this command in the path where you want to create the project): npm create vite@Latest

Installing dependencies (make sure you are inside the project directory): npm install
